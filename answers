CMPUT 313
Assignment 1

Part 1:
1.
The basic data types that are not structs or enums are the following.
CnetAddr
CnetColour
CnetData
CnetRandom
CnetTime
CnetTimerID

An int on the lab machine is 4 bytes/32 bits.
The only 32 bit integers in the above types are the CnetAddr and CnetTimerID.
All others are either void pointers, char pointers, input vars pointer or 64 bit ints.

2.
The node time is stored in the nodeinfo.time_in_usec variable.
You can print this variable using printf:

printf("Node time is %lld", nodeinfo.time_in_usec);

3.
You are able to specify minimum and maximum message sizes, however cnet.h does not specify
the content/format of the messages sent.
